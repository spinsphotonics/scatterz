# Simple framework for photonic simulation and optimization

[scatterz](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/scatterz) is a simple framework built on [utilz](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/utilz) and [fdtd-z](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz)
for computing the scattering-matrix (S-matrix) values of a photonic device and performing optimization on them.
